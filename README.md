Greetings!

Project designed to provide a comprehensive demonstration of the processes involved in creating tables, loading data, partitioning them, and organizing them into buckets. Additionally, we aim to showcase how to execute joins and subsequently load the merged data into a Hive table, facilitating further analytical queries.

Utilizes a sample dataset from a telecommunications company, offering a practical scenario for illustrating these essential data management and analysis techniques.

Key components of this project:

**Table Creation:** We'll begin by crafting the necessary tables to house our dataset. This involves defining the appropriate schema, specifying data types, and establishing any constraints essential for organizing and storing our telecom data efficiently.

**Data Loading:** With our tables in place, the next step entails loading the telecom dataset into the respective tables. This process ensures that our data is readily accessible for analysis and manipulation.

**Partitioning:** Partitioning plays a crucial role in optimizing data retrieval and query performance. We'll demonstrate how to partition our dataset based on relevant attributes such as date, region, or customer segment. By partitioning the data, we enhance query efficiency and enable faster access to subsets of information.

**Bucketing:** To further enhance query performance, we'll explore the concept of bucketing. By organizing data into buckets based on specific criteria, such as hash functions applied to a column, we can distribute data evenly across storage files. This strategy facilitates faster data retrieval and improves overall system efficiency.

**Joins:** Data often resides in multiple tables, necessitating the need for joins to consolidate information for analysis. We'll showcase various types of joins, including inner joins, outer joins, and cross joins, to merge relevant datasets and extract meaningful insights.

**Hive Table Creation:** Finally, we'll demonstrate how to create a Hive table, leveraging the power of Apache Hive for data warehousing and analysis. By loading our joined dataset into a Hive table, we enable seamless integration with Hive's querying capabilities, opening doors to a wide array of analytical queries and data exploration.
